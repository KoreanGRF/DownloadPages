detail_comment					:<b>Korean Town Names</b> contains Real city names and Virtual city names of Korea in one file.<br />Real city names contain 162 real 'Si' or 'Gun' level cities in Korea. Be aware that it could occur an error or be duplicated name from 163rd city.<br />Virtual city names are combinations of the real city's first letter and the last letter. It might be ridiculous name(ex. Gogi, Gido, Yesu...; which means meat, pray, jesus, respectively) for korean. It only make two letter names because korean city names are mostly two letter, and 'Buk(north)/Nam(south)/Dong(east)/Seo(west)' and 'Po(port)/San(Mt.)/Cheon(river)/Nae(stream)/Got(cape)' can be attached in front of/in back of the city names in some probablities.<br /><br /><b><span class="shadow" style="color:red;">Alert!</span></b> This NewGRF is written in <u>Hangeul</u>(Korean alphabet)<br />You need a font that can present korean letter such as Gulim, Dotum, Malgun Gothic, etc. It might be shown as broken if your PC does not have korean font.
